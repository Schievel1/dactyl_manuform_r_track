### Gherkin Midi
A gherkin midi layout that should cover most midi note playing needs.

A 3x8 grid of notes written bottom left to right upwards as notes for the selected mode, with octave and transpose note controls at the top. Menu accesses other mode layouts, persisted to keyboard settings, and a reset for firmware programming.

Modes are set by pressing Menu and their corresponding note from the C Ionian layout. That is, for Aeolian, press Menu and A 1. For Phrygian, press Menu and E 1.
