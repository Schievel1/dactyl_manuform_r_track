kpeatt's bface layout
======================

## Keyboard Notes
- This is for a clone bface PCB that is no longer for sale as far as I can tell. [Used to be sold on KBDFans](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/bface-60-RGB-underground-copy-pcb-from-china-gh60-pcb-Customize-keyboard-PCB/32731084597.html).
- To put in reset mode hold `left ctrl` while inserting the USB cable
- Use flashing instructions in the main `bface` directory

### Build
To build this keymap, run `make bface:kpeatt` from the qmk_firmware directory.
