# tomholford's layout

This layout is data-driven: I installed [WhatPulse](https://whatpulse.org/) a few months ago and generated a heatmap of the most frequently used keys. I also optimized for my most-used programming languages, and muscle memory.

## Changes from Default

### QWERTY

- swap escape and tab
- rearrange arrows in original layout
- swap rshift and Enter
- map / to original location of left arrow key

### RAISE

- move backslash to backspace
- map quote to original location from qwerty layer
- map brightness up / down to original location of left and up arrows
- map volume up / down to original location of down and right arrows

### LOWER

- move pipe to backspace
- map quote to original location from qwerty layer
- map brightness up / down to original location of left and up arrows
- map volume up / down to original location of down and right arrows

### ADJUST

- map to esc key: screenshot region to clipboard - an alias for ctrl + cmd + shift + 4


## RGB LED

- Illuminate when pressing RAISE, LOWER, or ADJUST ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/comments/8wvk8s/custom_rgb_configuration_by_keycodelayer/))
