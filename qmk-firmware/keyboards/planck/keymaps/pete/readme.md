# Planck Layout by Pete

This layout is based on the default layout but uses a FN key in the bottom left corner instead of the shift / backlight key.
On the FN layer you can do the following things

- Step through back light
- Put a mac to sleep
- The Fxx keys in a block to click with the right hand
- The delete key in the upper right corner
- Quick access to screenshot functions
- Control volume and media playback
- Home/PgDown/PgUp/End buttons where the arrow keys are

Pressing the lower and raise buttons allows to reset and change from QWERT to Colemak or Dvorak.
