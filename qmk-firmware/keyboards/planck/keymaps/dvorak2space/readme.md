# IsaacElenbaas's Planck Layout

Split spacebar, Dvorak. Bottom right button leads to layer with lots of things to be mapped in AutoHotkey. The ones I use (of which the best are sleep, which turns off the monitors and locks all inputs, rebinding keyboard-only mouse inputs, and redirecting media keys to a specific player) can be found [here.](https://github.com/IsaacElenbaas/personal_scripts/blob/master/Keyboard.ahk) Capslock goes to a right-hand navigation layer, there is a custom layer when holding shift, holding dash gives an em dash, holding backspace deletes a word, and I have a obfuscation-based password system you probably shouldn't use, but the rest is pretty standard.
