# @mgalisa's Planck keymap

A minor (so far) update to the default keymap. Probably more to come.

## Raise layer

* Moved F-keys and number keys into 4x3 and 3x3 grid patterns for pseudo-numpad like effect
* Added macros to the middle column that insert bracket/brace/paren pairs and moves the cursor inbetween
* Minor adjustments

## Emoji layer

Activate by holding the Esc key from QWERTY/Dvorak/Colemak. Holds macros primarily for annoying coworkers via Slack.
