# Mike's JD45 with 6u Spacebar

- Early draft of numsym that misses a lot of symbols
- Numpad layer available for evaluation
- Works with iPhone Camera Adapter
- Dynamic macros

## Layers

Qwerty for letters and mods.

Qwertymods layer switches some Modifiers around

Numsym puts the number keys across the top row like a Planck. Arrows are on hjkl
which makes the other NumSym dynamic from my other boards fall apart

Function layer replaces the top row numbers with Fkeys.

Numpad layer makes a number pad in the center.

Fkeynumpad replaces the numpad numbers with Fkeys.

Adjust layer has macros and configuration.
