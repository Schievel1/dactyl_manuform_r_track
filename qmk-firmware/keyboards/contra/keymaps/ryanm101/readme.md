# Layout Info
Map is from my JJ40 but Contra has been done with a grid vs my JJ's MIT layout. Map will be updated as soon as i figure out what to do with the addional key.

- Uses non-US keys
- Keymap can be seen: Keymap -> http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/7d111d72b138c3ef03ea4ffac4ddb7e4

# Notes

- .> on lower layer if tapped but ALTGR if held
- RAISE -> uses TT() so tap to enter (NUMPAD Usage) or hold for momentary (F Keys)
- LOWER on _RAISE goes straight to qwerty layout (Base layer)
