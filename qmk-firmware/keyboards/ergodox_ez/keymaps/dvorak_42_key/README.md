Overview
========

This is a dvorak based layout for the Ergodox EZ. Its basic key layout is similar to the Atreus "dvorak_42_key" layout. In fact this layout was created for seamless switching between the Ergodox EZ and Atreus. On the base layer, the keys that don't exist on the Atreus are mapped to MEH shortcuts and can be interpreted by Autohotkey. This layout only makes use of the 42 keys that the Atreus also has for the main functionality.
