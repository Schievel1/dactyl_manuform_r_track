# cijanzen's Pearl 40%

## Layout

The firmware offers five layers:

1. Base layer
2. Numbers and arrows (Fn1)
3. F-row and navigation (Fn2)
4. Media and RGB controls (Fn3)
5. Utils (Fn2+Fn3)

A few specifics worth mentioning:
- Autoshift has been enabled to allow for easier access of shifted keys
- Tab will operate as tab key on tap and fn layer on hold
- Indicator LEDs indicate the current layer
