My ClueBoard Layout as of 2017/06/30


This layout is a combination of the `mouse_keys` and the `win_optimized` layouts.
This layout is optimized for an ISO layout.
The CapsLock is disabled and works as ESC when tapped and FN when held.
The `TAB` key works as `TAB` when tapped, and [HYPER] (`CTRL` + `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `CMD`) when held.

## Mouse Layer

When you hold down the spacebar the arrow keys will move your mouse cursor.
You can click using the 3 mods to the left of the arrow keys, or the 3 keys under your primary fingers on the home row.
The Left, Down, Up and Right for the mouse movement are also VIM-Like on the HJKL keys

## MIDI layer

The MIDI layer is permanently enabled by pressing `FN` + `/`.
It can be exited with the `ESC`-Key

## Space Cadet(ish) Shift Parentheses

If the function layer is active, the `SHIFT`-Keys are configured like the [Space Cadet Shift Parentheses]
as opened (left `SHIFT`) and closed (right `SHIFT`) parentheses if tapped and `SHIFT` if held.

## Media layer

The media layer with Volume/Play controls, can be accessed via `FN` + `m`

## Control layer

The control layer is accessed via `FN` + `s`.
Here one can control the behavior of the RGB underlight.
`FN` + `s` + `1` resets the RGB underlight to the Layer signalling mode

## Layer signalling through underlight

The different layers are signalled throug setting of the underlight:

- Base layer: Light Blue
- Function layer: Yellow
- Media layer: Green
- Mouse layer: Blue
- Control layer: Red
- Midi layer: Purple
