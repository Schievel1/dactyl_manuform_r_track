# What I want from my LEVINSON (Let's Split on steroids) keymap
====================================================================================================


![My indigo Levinson keeb](https://i.imgur.com/sPfzSTk.jpg)

- media keys and media controls, including Eject, for however rare those computers with OSX *and* bloody optical drives might be
- in-switch LED intensity controls (+/-)
- underglow RGB hue/color controls
- underglow RGB intensity controls
- familiar key arrangement with Enter and symbols on the usual keys (to the right hand side, on some layer, pref RAISE for one-handed operation)
- navigation keys should be the vim ones really;
- arrow keys on one layer(most likely on the ADJUST one, but also on LOWER, as per my usual other split keebs)
- mouse keys too
- hardware reset for the ProMicro to put it bootloader mode, sounds, eeprom reset, backlights and rgb controls reset, etc.

See keymap.c for layouts
See config.h for various toggles and flags


P.S> this is my first fully and purely ortholinear keyboard, as opposed to my [Iris](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/keebio/iris/keymaps/omgvee "Vee's Iris keeb"), [Helidox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/omgvee "Vee's beloved Helidox keeb"), MiniDox, etc., which are mildly staggered, but on the vertical side, which seems better imho than this... but we'll see how I get on with it over time...
