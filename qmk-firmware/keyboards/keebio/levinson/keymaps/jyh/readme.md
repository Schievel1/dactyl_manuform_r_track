# jyh's levinson layout

[Levinson](https://keeb.io/products/levinson-lets-split-w-led-backlight)
built on rev2 PCBs. A split 4x12 keyboard with LED backlights.

The layout is oriented towards needs for programming, Emacs, XMonad,
and experience with 60% keyboards with no base layer arrow keys
(Poker). It makes heavy use of modifiers and layers.

## Layout features

  * Extensive use of _Mod Tap_, e.g.
     * Tap sends Esc, Hold sends Left Control
     * Tap sends Enter, Hold sends Right Shift
     * ... and many more
  * Hyper and Meh keys
  * Right modifier keys in place of arrow keys
    * Arrows are instead available in two alternate locations:
    * WASD arrows on _Adjust_
    * Arrow cluster on _Raise_ (inspired by hexwire)
  * Centered symbol/bracket cluster on _Lower/Raise_
    * Inspired by hexwire layout
    * Programming-oriented
  * Spacebar sends modifier keys on hold (_this is finicky in practice. may shut off completely_)
    * Control ~~and Alt/Meta~~ on left ~~and right~~ space, respectively
    * Strict space available on _Function_ and _Numpad_ layers
    * For Emacs keychords
  * Extra dedicated layers
    * Numpad (available with tap toggle)
    * Function key (F01-24)
  * Redunant keys where it is convenient to have characters together
    on one layer
