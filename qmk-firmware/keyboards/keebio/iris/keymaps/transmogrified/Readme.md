This layout is an attempt to make switching between the Iris and my laptop keyboard as seemless as possible. I switch caps lock and Ctrl/ESC on my laptop and I am able to adjust well with everything else... I still miss the Iris, but I am able to get work done.  

I use the following lighting queues to indicate layer changes.

* Momentary toggled layer : LEDs brighten and dim when layer is released.
* Locked layer : LEDs breath.
* Config layer locked : LEDs off.

NOTE you will need to flash both sides to update the brightness_levels so that breathing works on both sides as expected.
