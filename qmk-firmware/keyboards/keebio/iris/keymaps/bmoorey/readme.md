This is (what I consider to be) an improvement over the default Iris keymap.
It includes a QWERTY layer, a general system layer with arrows, volume control
and a numpad on the right board; a second raised layer with function keys and
more extensive media controls; and an adjust layer with controls for RGB
underlighting.
