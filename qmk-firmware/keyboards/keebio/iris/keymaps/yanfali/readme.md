## u/yanfali keymap for Iris

Based heavily off Hexwire's configuration. Differs in following ways:

 1. Moved LALT to LCTL; I don't need CTL because of ESCC.
 1. Moved RAISE to old LALT.
 1. Moved ENTER to old RAISE.
 1. Move QUOTE to old ENTER.
 1. Moved PLUS to old QUOTE.
 1. replaced music next and volume up with browser forward and back
    through history

This configuration lets me use my thumbs for enter and backspace.
It turns out I need `+` a lot for programming so I moved it logically
below `-`.  I also added a couple of web specific short cuts for
navigating previous and next in web history on OSX Chrome.
