# Pok3r Based iris Keymap

Pok3r was what got me into mechanical keyboards years ago and what has been my daily driver since, WhiteFox and the like being always on the periphery. As such, those keybinds are what is most natural and notably not in the default keymap configuration.

Make example for this keymap (after setting up your build environment):

    make iris/rev2:s1carii:avrdude

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information.
