## jennetters iris keymap

This keymap is based on the Iris default by [Bakingpy/nooges](https://github.com/nooges) without much deviation.

* The QERTY layer remains largely the same with repositioning of the control key for ease of use. 
* L/RBRC, L/RCBR, and PIPE added to raise layer.
* Arrow keys moved to wasd on raise layer.
* Grave Escape added to maintain usage of ESC/~/` with top left key.

See keymap.c for full details.
