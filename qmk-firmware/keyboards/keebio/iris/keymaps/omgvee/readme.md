- mouse keys
- media keys and media controls
- in-switch LED intensity controls (+/-)
- underglow RGB hue/color controls
- underglow RGB intensity controls
- familiar key arrangement with Enter and symbols on the usual keys (to the right hand side)
- navigation keys should be the vim ones really, and same ones used for mouse;
- also have alternates on the same layer, in the form of AWSD, as well as HJKL (keep in mind the order is Left, Up, Down, Right)
- arrow keys on one layer, however with another modifier key, they become left=home, right=end, up=page up, down=page Down
