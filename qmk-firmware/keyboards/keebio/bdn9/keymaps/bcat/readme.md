# bcat's BDN9 layout

This is a simple macropad with seven keys and two rotary encoders. We use one
encoder for volume and the other for backlight brightness. Six of the keys are
F keys (for gaming, since I use keyboards without function keys normally), with
the remaining key a layer toggle that switches the function keys between F1-F6
and F7-F12.
