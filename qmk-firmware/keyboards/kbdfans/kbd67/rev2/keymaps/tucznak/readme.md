# TuCZnak's modified layout

This layout is made for the ISO configuration of KBD67 (KBD65 v2 PCB).
It has a base layer, numpad on LT and a combined
configuration / macro / media layer.

Since the plate and PCB leak some underglow and the KBD67 case has no use
for it otherwise, containing no translucent parts, I've used the RGB OLEDs
as a capslock indicator.
