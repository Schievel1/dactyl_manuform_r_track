# Red Scarf II+

The Red Scarf II+ is an improved version of the Red Scarf II and is available in four different sizes. 

Ver A (RS Model F): 60% + Numpad on right, and Macro Keys on the left.  
Ver B (RS78): 65% + Macro Keys on the left.  
Ver C (RS68): 65%.  
Ver D (RS77): 60% + Numpad on right.

The Red Scarf II+ utilizes the same switch matrix across all its different versions. Therefore, firmware created for one will work on another. The caveat is that if you flash firmware built for the smaller boards onto a larger one, you will lose functionality of those extra keys. If you flash firmware built for a larger board onto a smaller one, the keys will operate normally. 

At this time, only the Ver B and the Ver C have been confirmed working with QMK.
