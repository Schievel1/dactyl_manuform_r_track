CMD-Preonic
===================
The CMD project seeks to improve productivity by optimizing usage of the left hand via clever use of the function layers. 

>Note: This project is currently optimized for grid layout, and has not been confirmed to work 100% on MIT layout, although it is expected to work correctly.

----------

Modes
-------------

####  QWERTY

>CMD-Qwerty is very similar to the default Preonic with a few key differences:

 - Dual-role Raise/Enter Key at Caps Lock position. -Don't need to take your hand off the mouse to submit URLs
 - Space_Function under left space (Grid layout) -Don't need to take your thumb off of the spacebar to use lower.
 - Dedicated arrow keys replaced with ( - , = , [ , and ] ) - big improvement for programmers who are used to fn layer.
