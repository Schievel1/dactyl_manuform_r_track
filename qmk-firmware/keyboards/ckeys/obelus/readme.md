Obelus
===

[The Obelus](https://imgur.com/a/vj4LF) is designed to provide an easy platform to work with for people who are new to building keyboards. It is also especially useful as a QMK testbed, featuring support for a lot of the interesting features of QMK including audio, and a lot of spare pins broken out to headers for hacking away.
