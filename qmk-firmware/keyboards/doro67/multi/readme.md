# Doro67 Multi PCB

65% custom keyboard made by 80ultraman/Alf/Backprop Studios with multiple layout support. Despite the layout options available, layout is dictated by the selected integrated plate.  

**MULTI-LAYOUT PCB (AVAILABILITY: CHINA + INTERNATIONAL GB)**
The "multi" directory includes keymaps for the multi-layout PCB, which supports ANSI, ISO, and multi (split backspace & non-blocker).
The keymap you choose from the "multi" directory must correspond to the integrated plate option you chose.

The multi-layout PCB and RGB pcb were the only two options available to NON-china buyers.
If you purchased an RGB PCB, please see the 'rgb' directory.
