# Doro67 RGB PCB

65% custom keyboard made by 80ultraman/Alf/Backprop Studios with in switch RGB featuring the same switch matrix and layout as the regular PCB. 

Flashing the regular PCB firmware on this board will work, but will disable RGB lighting. 

**THIS IS THE RGB PCB DIRECTORY (AVAILABILITY: CHINA + INTERNATIONAL GB)**
The "rgb" directory includes the keymap for the RGB PCB.

The multi-layout PCB and RGB pcb were the only two options available to NON-china buyers.
If you purchased a non-rgb PCB, please see the 'multi' directory.
