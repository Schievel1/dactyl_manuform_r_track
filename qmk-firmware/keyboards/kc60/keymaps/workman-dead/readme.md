## Layout reference

## Build

To build this keymap, simply run `make KEYMAP=workman-dead`.

## Notes

* the default layout is `workman` (try it out, it's awesome!), but it can be changed to `qwerty` with the `rebel` key (the function layer won't change though)
* `comma` acts as a dead key, that means tapping/holding it will activate the **oneshot** `dead key` layer (marked red in the reference)
* hold `space` to access the `function` layer (marked blue in the reference)
* hold `tab` to activate the mouse layer
* the `function` layer contains mostly osx specific shortcuts
* on the right side of the bottom row `alt` and `super` are switched compared to a standard layout
