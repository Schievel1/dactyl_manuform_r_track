# Waples Let's Split keymap
[Waples](https://www.github.com/Waples)

## My (forever) Work-In-Progress keymap for my Let's Split keyboard. 
My keymap is much like the default, I just personally like to have my Enter and Escape key to be on my home row. The Escape key doubles as a Control key when held down, my Enter key functions as (right)Shift when held down.
Everything you see below here is constantly *under construction*, so there may be some dumb things in this, which are already gotten taken out, or are still in there :P.

### Layers
I currently have the following layers in my keymap:
* Qwerty 	(as default)
* Dvorak	(still learning this type of layout, so not really used much)
* Gaming	(WIP! I tried some I found, but didn't like them, so I'm in the progress of making my own)
* Lefty		(lower)
* Righty	(raise)
* Dual		(adjust)
