======================

This is the preferred 60% layout used by u/merlin36, host of the [MechMerlin YouTube channel](www.youtube.com/mechmerlin).

## Keyboard Notes
- The FaceW Sprit Edition can be purchased on [mechanicalkeyboards.com](www.mechanicalkeyboards.com)
- Uses ps2avru instead of ps2avrgb
- To put in reset mode hold `q` while inserting the USB cable
- Use flashing instructions from ps2avrgb QMK port

## Keymap Notes
- Does not support any form of inswitch lighting as Merlin hates them.
- Arrow toggle switch to the right of right shift
- Reset is FN + Left Shift + R

### Build
To build this keymap, simply run `make bfake:mechmerlin` from the qmk_firmware directory.
