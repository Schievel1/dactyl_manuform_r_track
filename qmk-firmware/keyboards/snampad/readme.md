# snampad

A small weekend project to create a numeric keypad for the few times I need such a thing.
I created the schematics in Kicad, 3D printed the case, handwired the prototype, used some
spare Zealios, Box Royals and SA keycaps.

When I get some time I'd like to make a PCB for it.

It uses a promicro controller and the reset button has been made availabe through a hole in the backplate.


Keyboard Maintainer: [Peter Tillemans](https://github.com/ptillemans)
Hardware Supported: Promicros are ubiquitous.
Hardware Availability: This uses essentially spares from other projects


Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make snampad:default
