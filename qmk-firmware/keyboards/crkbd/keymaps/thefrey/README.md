# Keyboard layout by the-frey

This is a layout that allows access to all the paren keys easily, has a tab on the lower layer (for SUPER-TAB app switching) and some utility features like PGUP/PGDOWN and HOME/END.

In addition, the arrows are on the lower layer and are bound to the vim keys (h,j,k,l). I've found this a productive layout for programming in emacs and hopefully you will too. 

The layout image above shows the keymap, with each key marked with all three layers:

- The top indicates the raise layer
- The middle indicates the default layer
- The bottom indicates the lower layer

All the keys respond as you'd expect to the 'shift' key - i.e. on a UK/GB keyboard, `/` becomes `?` and so on.
