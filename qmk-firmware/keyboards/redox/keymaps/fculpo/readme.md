# A tweaked keymap for Redox

This keymap modifies the [default keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/redox) for the awesome [Redox keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) designed by Mattia Dal Ben.

Also heavily inspired by nrichers layout.

## Changes to the default keymap

These keymap changes are meant to improve the usability of the layout in everyday use:

- Move `GUI` (`SUPER`) key to where default left `CTRL` is
- Move `/?` into usual location next to right `SHIFT` - the default flash from Falbatech put `\|` here (might not be the Redox default?), which felt unintuitive
- Put `\|` into bottom-left spot where `GUI` (`SUPER`) was - had to go somewhere and this bottom-left placement sort of balances with the almost bottom-right `/?`
- Change default `ESC` into `ESC` on tap, `CTRL` on hold - Love the UNIX-ey `CTRL` key location and wanted to keep `ESC` in the original position
- Change default `'` above right `SHIFT` into `'` on tap, `CTRL` on hold - Love the UNIX-ey CTRL key location, but it can give you 'left claw hand', which a second, mirrored `CTRL` key fixes
- Add `F11` and `F12` keys to two layers - needed on macOS if you want to control volume up and down from your keyboard (not shown, on a different layer)S
