# stephengrier's TADA68 layout

This layout mostly replicates the default ANSI layout of the TADA68 but with a
few modifications to suit my tastes.

The modifications from the default keymap are:

* Replaced capslock with a second function key
* Swapped the left ALT and Win keys to be more like the Mac layout
* Added an arrow key cluster on the IJKL keys
* Fn+x toggles backlight breathing mode

With this keymap backlight breathing mode can be enabled/disabled with Fn+x.
This is not supported at all in the default keymap.
