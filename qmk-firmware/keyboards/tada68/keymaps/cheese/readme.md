# pgillan's Cheese TADA68 layout

A collection of tweaks to make the keyboard more mac friendly and increase personal usability,
based on the default keymap.

* Turned the caps-lock into an additional function key so I didn't have to try to hit the
  the keys on the right with one hand.
* Moved the arrow/mouse controls to the caps-lock layer from the function layer.
* Swapped the Windows key and Alt keys, I didn't have to do it in OS X.
* Made the escape key work as a backtick when "Alt" is depressed, so I can 1) reverse
  direction when I Alt-Tab through current applications, and Alt-Backtick through 
  open windows.
* Turned the backtick/tilde key into another backspace key, so I can just go all the way
  up to the corner without overshooting.
* Adjusted the volume controles so M is "mute", the "," ( or "<") is "down", and "." (or ">") 
  is "up".  It just makes a ton more sense, I have no idea why it would have been done any
  differently.
* Moved PageUp/PageDown up above the delete key, and made the Home and End on the capslock
  and function layers.
* Made the tab key on the function layer output 4 spaces instead of a tab character.
