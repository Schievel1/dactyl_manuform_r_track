# TADA68 layout for ISO UK

This layout has been tested on a TADA68 purchased from kbdfans in March 2018. The physical key layout includes the "double height" iso Enter key and the "short" Left Shift along side the iso Backslash key. [See this keyboard-layout-editor.com Gist](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/acf0f32f7ea0d0ed35c901663ca47919)

The Base Layer and Function layer defined here match the layout defined by the kbdfans keyboard layout tool found at http://123.57.250.164:3000/tada68
