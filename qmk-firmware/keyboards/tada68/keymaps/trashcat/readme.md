# Trashcat's Tada68

Just my simple layout for the Tada68.  
Caps Lock behaves as LCtrl until switched to the Gaming Layer. I have a stupid reason for why I need caps lock at all but I won't get into it.  
LCtrl is also LCtrl because I had no idea what else to put there.  

Tap Dance for the F Row.. i.e double tap 1 and get F1 instead.
