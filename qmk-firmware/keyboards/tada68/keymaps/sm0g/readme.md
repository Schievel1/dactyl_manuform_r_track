Just my simple layout for the Tada68.  
Space [Cadet Shift](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_space_cadet_shift) is enabled.  
LCTRL and Caps have been swapped and the new CTRL also acts as ESC when tapped and CTRL when held.  
This is helpful for me as a VIM user.  
Some other changes.  

Tap Dance for the F Row.. i.e double tap 1 and get F1 instead.
