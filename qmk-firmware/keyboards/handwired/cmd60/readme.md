# CMD60

![CMD60](https://i.imgur.com/r9LA6Lx.jpg)

This layout has been designed to optimize use of the left-hand, and it focussed specifically on programmers who work
with text editors like SublimeText and Atom. It utilizes the power of Space_fn, and features a caps lock swap for Fn2
and enter key on tap. These features allow you to keep your right hand on the mouse more and should enable you to
achieve a higher level of productivity if you take the time to learn its function layers.
