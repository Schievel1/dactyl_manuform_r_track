# DataHand

A keyboard designed to prevent RSI. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand) and [this website](http://octopup.org/computer/datahand) for more info.

To use this firmware, you have to replace the stock microcontroller with a Teensy++ 2.0. This is relatively easy and also reversible. See the notes at the bottom of datahand.h for more info.
