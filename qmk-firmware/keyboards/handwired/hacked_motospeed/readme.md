# hacked_motospeed

This is a
   - tiny (44key),
   - budget (~50â‚¬ total expense),
   - portable (HID bluetooth & 5aH battery)
   - easy to diy (little wiring & soldering needed),         
   
mechanical keyboard.   
It is made by wiring two Motospeed K22 numpads to a Teensy++ 2.0, while reusing as much of the original PCB as possible.
The numpads come with Outemu red linear switches.  
(A detailed guide will be posted and linked later)
