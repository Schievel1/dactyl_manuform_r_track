A compact 60% keyboard designed by Fate Everywhere and sold on a limited basis. Born out of the desire for a Planck with a numpad for technical work.

Keyboard Maintainer: [Fate Everywhere](https://github.com/fateeverywhere)  
Hardware Supported: 4x16 T&E Prototype, Mark Zero Stand Aside.  
Hardware Availability: No longer available, was a tester for Stand Aside. Build definitions are in handwired because two units are in the wild.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/412_64:default
