tiger_lily
==========

This is the firmware for Rev. 20161114 of the Tiger Lily controller by [Bathroom Epiphanies](http://bathroomepiphanies.com/controllers/), a replacement controller for the [Filco Majestouch 2 104 key](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1819). Bathroom Epiphanies has advised that the source is also compatible with the Black Petal controller, however I do not own an example to test against.

The code was adapted from the [BathroomEpiphanies TMK Firmware](https://github.com/BathroomEpiphanies/epiphanies_tmk_keyboard/tree/master/be_controllers).
