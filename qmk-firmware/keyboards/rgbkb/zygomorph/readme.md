Zygomorph is the thinnest keyboard with a fully enclosed case. It's only 3.2mm thick below the switches, including screws. It can be used in 5x6 and 4x6 split, or 5x12 and 4x12 combined. It has per-key RGB, supports Kailh Choc and MX switches, and has 10 rotary encoder positions per half (only one can be used per half). The board has pre-soldered components, including type C ports and ATmega32U4. The build guide can be found [here](https://rgbkb.gitbook.io/rgbkb-build-guides/zygomorph-build-guide/).
