Jetpacktuxedo's Keymap
===

Split backspace, 6.25u space, caps is fn, my standard fn layer, reset + rgb controls on layer(2)

Keymap Maintainer: [Ethan Madden](https://github.com/jetpacktuxedo)

Difference from base layout: The base layer is the same, except caps is fn, and there are additional tools on layers

Intended usage: This is my daily driver keymap
