Default Keymap
===

Super simple default keymap with only a base layer.

Keymap Maintainer: [Ethan Madden](https://github.com/jetpacktuxedo)

Difference from base layout: This is (as close as I can tell) the same as the layout that ships on the boards other than default underglow color.

Intended usage: This is mostly provided for testing before you build your own keymap and as a reference to a stock(ish) configuration
