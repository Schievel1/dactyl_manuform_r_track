# Gamepad Layout by @wavebeem

The concept behind this layout is the left side of a computer keyboard,
optimized with essential keys for playing FPS games. It was designed for TheVan
RoadKit, but it should work for any 4x4 ortholinear keyboard.

I play with my pinky on `Shift`, thumb on `Space`, and the rest of my fingers on
`W A S D`. I use my thumb for `Control`, `X`, and sometimes `C`. I usually use
`Z` with my ring finger. It also helps to angle my fingers more perpendicular to
the board in order to allow my thumb to more easily access the `Z X C` row.

The number keys `1 2 3` are missing for weapon switching, but you can usually
switch with the mouse wheel or rebind those to `Z X C` or something else.

The key `R` for reloading is missing, but I prefer to use my extra mouse buttons
for that.

I don't really use `Alt` for games, but I kept it around for `Alt-Tab` in
Windows.
