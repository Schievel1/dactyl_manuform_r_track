# Belak's TV44 (TV46?) layout

This layout is roughly based on the low-rider arrow-southpaw layout from [the
configurator](http://minivan.config.thevankeyboards.com) with a number of
changes to make it easier to use and add in missing keys (like adding / and '
to the main layer)

## Rev1

* Moved enter to a more standard location to have a full spacebar
* Quote is now on L1
* Small tweaks to make modifiers work a little more consistently
* Greatly increase the tapping term to make the tap-dance mods easier to use
