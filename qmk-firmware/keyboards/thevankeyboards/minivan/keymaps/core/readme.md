# A minivan keymap based off the Vertex Core

## Main differences

* There are only 3 keys on the bottom right, so menu was dropped
* There are only 3 keys on the bottom left, so Pn was dropped because there is
  no programmable layer.
* There are only 12 keys in the first row, so the delete key (along with scroll
  lock) has been dropped.
* The F1-F12 keys have been shifted by 1 so they all fit in the first row of
  layer 2.
* Moved the grave/tilde to layer 1 (because in layer 2 it's now taken up by F1).
* Keys relating to speed have been removed
* The `L_Win + L_Alt + R_spacebar = R_Shift, R_Alt, Menu and R_Ctrl as arrow
  keys` as mentioned in the manual does not work.
* The layer 2 plus shift should have support for symbols in the first row (where
  the F1-F12 keys are) but this has not been implemented, so you need to use the
  second row (where the numbers are).
