# Budi's TV44 Arrow layout

- Dvorak main layer
- Somewhat easy bracket access for easy devs, happy :)
- Dedicated gaming layers cuz u don't wanna mess with apm
- Mainly for windows, but with translated alt/cmd on os, it's good to go

ASCII graphics shamelessly stolen from tong92's layout :)

Updates August 2018:
- Escape both ways
- Only include QMK_KEYBOARD_H

Updates July 2018:
- I guess I don't play games that much anymore
- SUGDW modifiers
- Somehow LALT(LSFT(KC_RET)) does not register correctly on my mac
