Mnemes Swedish Bonanza
=======================

My Layout in process, most of the code is shamelessly stolen from [algernons][algernon] excellent layout

 [algernon]: https://github.com/algernon/ergodox-layout

It's for Windows (current work forces me to) and Swedish (matter of birth) so ymmw.

## Base layer

* The number row doubles as a function row. Short presses produces numbers, long presses produces Fxx
* The `Shift`, `Alt`, and `Control` modifiers are one-shot.
* `Backspace` and `Enter` doubles as switches to the `sym` layer when held
* The `ESC` key also doubles as a one-shot cancel key.
* The **Lead** key is followed by a sequence of keys.
    - `LEAD l`   : `lgui+l`.
    - `LEAD s l` : `λ`.
    - `LEAD s s` : `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
    - `LEAD s f` : `凸(ツ)凸`
    - `LEAD u l` : Set unicode input mode to linux.
    - `LEAD s w` : Set unicode input mode to windows.
    - `LEAD a *` : Application switching based on position in start menu. Very specific to my computer.


## Nav layer

Basic navigation on the right hand and modifiers close
by for the left. The latter because I tend to use `ctrl+arrows` quite a lot.

## Sym layer

* Easy access to most symbols I use on a daily basis. Most common are on the home row, the rest are grouped as best as I could.

- `eq` : Tapdance, produces `===` and `!==`
- `fun`: Tapdance, produces `=>` and `() => {\n`
