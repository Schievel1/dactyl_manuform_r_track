# CRS 4x12 Ortholinear Layout

Since I started with a Planck and a 2u space, it's not as optimal on a split or grid but it's what I'm used to using.

Goals:

* Maximum compatibility with standard keyboards
  * I have to work on other staggered Qwerty keyboards all the time so I wanted to keep essentially the same layout instead of optimizing too much.
* Trying to fit as many characters as possible on the default layer
  * its easier for me to remember logical functions than characters
  * Using the extra punctuation caps in place of arrows frees up some Row 4 caps
  * however, I'm trying out an arrows layout with the other punctuation on the Raise layer and it is quite nice too
* A number pad AND a number row

[Here is the layout in easily readable KLE form.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/c6c0ac051b2b118a34ef84ebadab54c7)
