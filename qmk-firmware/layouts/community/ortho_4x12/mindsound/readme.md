# Josh's 4x12 layout

Notable features:

* Esc is Ctrl on hold
* Left space is `MOD_HYPER` on hold
* Backspace is still backspace on `RAISE` and `LOWER`
* Faux clicky controls are on the arrow keys on the `ADJUST` layer, and the backlight controls are directly above that
* Backlight breathing is disabled; backlight flickering is implemented instead
* Colemak and other layouts are thoroughly disabled
* Rotary encoder controls media volume on base layer

This layout has been tested on:

* Let's Split (rev 2)
* Let's Split Vitamins Included (rev 1)
* Planck (rev 4)

It builds for the Planck rev 6 but has not been tested yet.
