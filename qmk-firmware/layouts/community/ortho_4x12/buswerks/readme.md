# Logan's Ortho 4x12 Layout

This layout is what I use on my Planck. Some features of the layout:

- Rotary encoder support (no function for clicking yet)
- Numpad under right hand (I find this much more comfortable than touch-typing the number row)
- Space cadet shift
- Curly braces are under the home row (makes programming much more comfortable)

Also, another note: the QWERTY layout uses `LGUI_T(KC_ESC)` and the COLEMAK/DVORAK layouts use `LCTL_T(KC_ESC)`. This is because I use the QWERTY layout on my Mac laptop so that I don't have to change the software remapping every time I dock my laptop. This also allows a convenient remapping of the modifier keys. I use the hardware mapped COLEMAK layout on Linux.
