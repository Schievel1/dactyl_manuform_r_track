# teckinesis Layout

*A blend of TECK and Kinesis layouts, based on ["The Ordinary Layout" by Nicholas Keene](/layouts/community/ergodox/ordinary)*

I love "The Ordinary Layout", but I still use a [TECK](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php)
at the office, and I found the transition back and forth to be a bit more difficult than I expected.

This layout consists of only slight changes to "The Ordinary Layout" based on the layouts of the 
[(original) TECK Model 209](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/layout-designer--configurator--reprogrammable--truly-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard/#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) and
