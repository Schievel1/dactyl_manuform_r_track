The kastyle keymap was originally intended to remap the ErgoDox EZ to more
closely approximate the layout of a Kinesis Advantage. Notable changes
over the stock ErgoDox layout include:

  * Re-arragnement of tab, enter, space, and delete to match the Kinesis
  * Addition of print screen, pause, etc. keys following the kines-ish keymap
  on L1
  * GUI keys have replaced Ctrl on the thumb keys (for Mac use), and Alt keys
  are mapped to allow Esc on tap (good for Vi users)
  * Most notably, the addition of a momentary one-handed mode for quick and
  easy access to keys on the other half of the keyboard, e.g. while using a 
  mouse in one hand, one may add text to a dialogue box with the other without
  having to reach across the keyboard or remove one's hand from the mouse.
