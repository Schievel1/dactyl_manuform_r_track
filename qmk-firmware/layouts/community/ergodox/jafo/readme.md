# ErgoDox EZ "jafo" Configuration

This is a layout based on the ErgoDox Ez default layout, but with some
customizations I made for my use-case.  I use Linux, vi and the i3 window
manager, so I made these changes:

- Arrow keys laid out in vi positions in media layer.

- Esc (tap) and Win (held) to the left of A.  i3 uses Win key for navigation
  and having that be symmetric on the left and right makes it easier.

- Grave accent below equals, I was having a hard time using ~

- Layer 2 switch below the L1 switch, so I can go into a mode where I get
  arrow keys under my vi motion fingers.

- Making the Ctrl (held) and Esc (tap) on my thumbs symmetric.  Not sure I
  need that with the Esc left of A and Ctrl on the Z and / keys when held...
