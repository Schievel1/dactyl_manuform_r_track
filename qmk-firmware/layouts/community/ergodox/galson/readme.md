# Galson keymap


Sep 26, 2016.

This is an ergonomic layout for programming for those with typing-related injuries. Key features:

- As many symbol keys as possible are accessible without shifting. These should be accessed by moving the entire hand and pressing with a strong finger.
- Arrow keys and left and right mouse clicks for mouse-free navigation when combined with head mouse or eyetracker.
- Modifier keys are dual role and relocated to positions convenient for the index finger.
- Positions are more convenient when the keyboard is vertically mounted (as it should be!)
