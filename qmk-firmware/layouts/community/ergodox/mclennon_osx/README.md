# Ergodox EZ for OS X

This keymapping is designed to be reasonably familiar to an ordinary Mac keyboard while taking advantage of the Ergodox EZ's features. Caps lock instead enables a layer which allows a user to use HJKL as arrow keys and to control media. Shift and control have additional mappings on S and D to provide easier access while holding down caps lock.
