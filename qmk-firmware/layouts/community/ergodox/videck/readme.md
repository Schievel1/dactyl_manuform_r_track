ViDeck keymap for ErgoDox
=========================

This is a QWERTY layout based on the US layout, where Vi functionality has been
especially considered.

# Features
* Mouse movements using the Vi movement keys.
* Vi movement keys doubling as arrow keys.
* Shift lock using double tap.
* A coder's modifier key for easy input of parenthesis.
* Acess to the escape key using either thumb.
* Reasonably accessible Scroll Lock key (useful if you, like me, want to switch
  to a non-US layout once in a while in X).

# Missing keys
* Caps Lock (shift lock is used instead).
* Pause/Break.
* Print Screen.

# LEDs
* Shift lock is indicated using first LED.
* Arrow keys layer is indicated using second LED.
* Mouse keys layer is indicated using third LED.
