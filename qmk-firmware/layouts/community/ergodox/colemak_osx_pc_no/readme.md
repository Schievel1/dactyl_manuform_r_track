# Norwegian Colemak setup with osx/pc toggle

## Motivation
I wanted a Norwegian Colemak setup that worked in a similar way on both my Mac and PC. I  also wanted it to translate from a standard Norwegian keyboard OS setup.

## Overview
The setup is created to be programmer friendly.
- Most of the symbols used in code can be activated without using layers or shift key.
- You can reach the IDE/OS shortcut activators(Ctrl, Win/Cmd, Alt, Shift) with the thumb.
- Navigation is prioritized, arrows are right below the home row.

## PC/Mac toggle
The default setup is for Norwegian keyboard setting(not colemak variants) on a PC(Windows or Linux). Use the Mac/PC toggle button to switch between OSX and PC setup. The settings will be reverted to PC setup each time you restart/connect the keyboard.

## Layers
Numbers and function buttons are on their own layers. The easiest way to switch layers(at least with my hands) in this setup, is to push your hand right below the little finger, on the layer switches. You will then have all your fingers free to type numbers or press function buttons.

## Shift-key
Tap for the next character to be shifted, hold down for regular shift functionality
