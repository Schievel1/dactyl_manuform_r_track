# Beginner's keymap for Ergodox-EZ
Beginner's keymap emulates standard QWERTY keyboard for beginners. Once you get comfortable with the Ergodox-EZ, you may fork this keymap and customize it for your own needs or find a suitable one from the community contributed keymaps.

#### Pros
* Easier to switch between regular keyboards and Ergodox-EZ.
* Easy on beginners. It has everything you need for your day to day usage.

#### Cons
* Keys are not ergonomically placed to take full advantage of Ergodox-EZ. Take a look at this [Default Keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/layouts/default/ergodox/default_ergodox/keymap.c)
* While multiple layers are possible, beginner's keymap only uses one additional layer for mouse, function and volume keys.

#### Notes
* Ideally number key [6] should have started from the right-hand side of the keyboard. Doing so breaks the familiar QWERTY layout.
* Quote key ['] should have been placed between [:] and [Enter]. Due to lack of key space, it is placed below [Enter].
* Double [Alt] keys are placed adjacent to each other for convenience.
* [CapsLock] also acts as [Ctrl] key when you press and hold. It is convenient for GNU Emacs users.
* Additional bracket keys are placed in the center of the keyboard for programmer's convenience.
