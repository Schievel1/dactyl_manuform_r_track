Dvorak Programmer Layout
========================

This is a dvorak-only layout. The overall philosophy is that the left hand contains a number of layer-switching shortcuts, and the right hand key codes vary based on the layer selected.

Layers
------

* BASE: this is where you type.
* SHELL_NAV: hold down the Tab key to access shell/terminal navigation shorcuts such as forward/backward word, history, Ctrl+C, screen tab movement.
* KEY_NAV: arrow key movement with backward/forward word support, and copy/paste.
* KEY_SEL: same as above, but every movement shift-selects.
* NUMBER: keypad layer.
* SYMBOL: all the symbols.
* BRACKET: special brackets-only layer for programming. Activated by pressing left capslock (OSL)
* SHORTCUTS: sends Hyper keys for Autohotkey to interpret. I use this to switch between specific apps.
* MOUSE: use mouse keys
