# Roman's Layout

There are four layers:

- **BASE** is [Norman layout](https://normanlayout.info/).
- **SYMB** for numbers and symbols.
- **PLVR** is optimized for [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org).
- **ARRW** for navigation (same fingers for arrows as IJKL on QWERTY).

Looking for HJKL arrows? [Here we

**IMPORTANT**: If you have another keyboard connected via Bluetooth, then

## CTRL/ESC

Both of those keys are frequently used in Vim.
